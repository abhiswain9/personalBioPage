        <p> I am currently a student at Washington University in St. Louis graduating in May 2016. I am a major in Computer Science
          with a minor in Finance. I am interested in the convergence of Technology and Business, and particularly how to simplify financial engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the classroom, I like climbing and playing soccer. I follow London's Chelsea Football Club. I will be joining
          Goldman Sachs in New York after graduation. My long-term goal is to receive an MBA and work in consulting.
